Trapped ions are one of the leading platforms for quantum computation and quantum simulation [1–3]. Numerous experiments have demonstrated the ability of the
analog trapped-ion quantum simulator to emulate the dynamics of quantum magnetism models [3–7] and to study
the dynamics of quantum information and quantum entanglement [8–10].
One of the main advantages of the trapped-ion quantum simulators is the tunability of the interaction range,
as well as the ability to realize one- and two-dimensional
